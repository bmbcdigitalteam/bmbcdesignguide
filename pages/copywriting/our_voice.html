        <h1>Our voice</h1>
        <p>Editoral writing guidelines</p>
        <p>Status production</p>
        <p>Although at the council we are one organisation, we have many departments that do very different things.</p>
        <p>All departments should communicate using the same rules, so that there is a single customer experience for our users when they deal with the council.</p>
        <h2>Tone of voice</h2>
        <p>Tone of voice is the way we communicate at Barnsley Council, and in this context, the words we choose to use for digital communications with our customers and visitors to our website.</p>
        <p>It's our job, as content and service providers, to give people access to our information and services online as quickly and efficiently as we can. The way we speak influences how our customers access our services online and the quality of their transaction or time spent with us. Having a set of tone of voice principles helps us to make sure customers and visitors to our website have a consistent experience of Barnsley Council, whatever they're looking for.</p>
        <p>We have three 'values' that represent our personality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>helpful</li>
            <li>direct</li>
            <li>no jargon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These values guide the style of our writing and help us find the right words when we're producing communications.</p>
        <h2>Our personality in action</h2>
        <p>It's much easier to understand the Barnsley Council tone of voice when you see it in action. We've organised some handy do and don't examples under our tone of voice values to help you get things right.</p>
        <p>Being helpful means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>involving the audience</li>
            <li>saying 'you'</li>
            <li>speaking clearly</li>
            <li>using questions</li>
        </ul>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Helpful isn't</th>
                <th>Helpful is</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>If you wish to pay by another method or are having difficulty in paying your bills please refer to our other ways to pay page</td>
                <td>Struggling to pay? Need another way to pay? Find out about other ways to pay</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inter-library loans may be borrowed from many types of library including public, university and special as well as the British Lending Library</td>
                <td>Can't find what you want? You can borrow items from other libraries</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Being direct means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>shorter sentences - aim for no more than 20 words, and a mix of sentence lengths to make content readable</li>
            <li>active verbs where possible - 'We collect bins', not 'Bins are collected'</li>
            <li>positive language - use words that encourage eg 'You can…', or 'Apply for…'</li>
            <li>shortening verbs - isn't for is not; you're for you are</li>
        </ul>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct isn't</th>
                <th>Direct is</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Guidance on how the general public can gain access to recorded information held by public bodies</td>
                <td>How to ask for access to council information</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Certain factors are taken into consideration that will determine what action is to be taken by the council such as, size and depth of the pothole, speed and volume of traffic and position of the pothole on the road or footpath</td>
                <td>We'll make a decision on what to do about the pothole by looking at: <ul><li>size and depth</li><li>position on road and footpath</li><li>speed and volume of traffic</li></ul></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Failure to register your baby's birth may leave you liable to prosecution but will also make it impossible for you to receive family allowance or register your baby with a doctor</td>
                <td>If you don't register your baby's birth, you won't be able to get family allowance or register your baby with a doctor. There's a risk you could be brought to court too</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>No jargon means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>using phrases that everyone can understand</li>
            <li>finding different ways of talking about services</li>
            <li>avoiding acronyms (where initials are used to abbreviate) where you can</li>
            <li>avoiding 'council speak'</li>
        </ul>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>No jargon isn't</th>
                <th>No jargon is</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The council supplements this approach by providing grit bins at strategic locations on non-primary routes to allow self-help by motorists and pedestrians who encounter difficulties in adverse weather conditions</td>
                <td>On other routes, we provide grit bins where they are needed, so you can grit the road or pavement yourself</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Household bin collection</td>
                <td>Collecting everyday rubbish</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>Our name</h2>
        <p>Our name is a key part of our brand and we write it in every communication we make.</p>
        <p>Wherever you can, use 'we' when you talk about Barnsley Council, what we do and what we can do. We're a council providing services to nearly a quarter of a million people locally, and more besides, including tourists, visitors, businesses and investors. Sometimes you'll need to talk about Barnsley Council in the third person, such as if you're introducing us for the first time, or writing a more formal communication like a report:</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">Barnsley Council supports people with different needs, helping them to live as full lives as possible</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p>We use 'we' (first person plural) when we talk to customers, or talk about the council's activities and attitudes:</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">We will assess your application…</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p>But when talking about what customers can do, use 'you' (second person) as much as you can - it reflects the way customers think and speak:</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">You can set up a direct debit…</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p>We use the third person ('is', 'does', etc) when we introduce Barnsley Council for the first time, or in more formal communications:</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">Barnsley Council serves the needs of almost a quarter of a million people…</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p>If you need to be a bit more specific - for example, to refer to a particular department - it's fine to mention that, and then go back to using 'we':</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">As a highway authority, we are responsible for…</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <h2>Writing for different audiences</h2>
        <p>While much of our site is aimed at the general public in Barnsley, some parts are more specialised.</p>
        <p>For example, we have pages specifically for landlords, business owners, and people working in child protection.</p>
        <p>Each of these audiences requires a slightly different 'voice'. It's a matter of thinking about our existing tone of voice, and deciding how to mix the values in different proportions to get the voice we want.</p>
        <p>For example, a piece of guidance that has legal implications may need to be less 'direct', because fullness and accuracy are important. Similarly, a page that is aimed at a particular audience may use specialist terms which, to anyone else, would look like jargon. So we would ease off on the 'no jargon' principle, while remaining as 'direct' and 'helpful' as possible.</p>
        <h3>Assumed knowledge</h3>
        <p>One thing we need to be careful of is the level of knowledge we assume in our readers. This doesn't mean that we have to explain everything: but we need to make sure they won't get confused because they don't know the specialist terms or background information that may seem obvious to us.</p>
        <p>For example: how many members of the public would know what a 'freedom of information request' is? Or what the Information Commissioner does? While you don't have to give a long explanation of these, it's a good idea to provide links to background information - on other sites, if appropriate - while keeping the page copy focused on what the user wants to achieve.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it could be okay to assume that your reader does have some background knowledge - for example, if you're writing for a specialist audience, they may already be familiar with background terms and concepts. Think carefully about who you are writing for - and if you can, speak to a member of the target audience to check your assumptions.</p>
