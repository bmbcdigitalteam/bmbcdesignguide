        <h1>Search engine optimisation</h1>
        <p>Editoral writing guidelines</p>
        <p>Status production</p>
        <p>The words we use in our copy play a part even before people get to our site.</p>
        <p>There are ways we can structure our copy and the terms we use to make it much easier to find in search engines. In many cases, Barnsley Council is the only organisation offering certain services in the area and our visibility in search engines is naturally good. However, we can follow some simple rules to optimise our copy and improve our online search ranking results. This is especially important when it comes to promoting services where we have private sector competitors eg fostering, adult education and land searches.</p>
        <p>These guidelines are designed to help you create SEO-friendly copy for each web page.</p>
        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>Tips for writing keywords:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write down your key information and then select two to three keywords from that paragraph which you think someone may use to find us using a search engine.</li>
            <li>Then write the rest of the copy, mentioning those keywords between three and six times – but only if it doesn’t sound forced.</li>
            <li>There should be a higher concentration of keywords near the top of the page. Use keywords at least once in your opening paragraph.</li>
            <li>You may wish to review existing pages on your site/microsite to see if you can improve the SEO by copy alone.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Page content</h2>
        <p>Tips for writing page content:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to keep each page as unique as possible – if you find yourself moving on to another subject, create another page.</li>
            <li>Anchor text (links) – think about where you place your links in your copy. The higher up the page they appear, the more important search engines consider them to be.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Alternative text</h2>
        <p>Alternative (‘Alt’) text is the description that goes along with every image, for the benefit of people who use a screen reader or browse with images turned off.</p>
        <p>It’s a good idea to put keywords in your Alt text. Rather than writing, ‘Woman using computer’ write, ‘Woman searching for information about getting married from Barnsley Council’. (The accessibility section has more about Alt text.)</p>
