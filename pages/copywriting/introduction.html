        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Editoral writing guidelines</p>
        <p>This writing guide helps you to produce content and related communications for our organisation's website.</p>
        <p>It features tips, examples and an editorial style guide to help make sure the content that is produced for our website and other digital channels is clear, usable, customer-friendly and most importantly consistent.</p>
        <p>When writing content for our website, try to keep its vision statement in mind:</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p class="indent">Our website will give people quick and easy access to our services and clear information about life and work in Barnsley</p>
        <p class="indent">"</p>
        <p>Bear in mind that this guide applies specifically to writing for the web. Although it requires similar skills and techniques to writing for print, there are a few factors that make it different:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People are much more impatient on the web - they have a problem to solve, a task to complete, and they need the one thing that meets their immediate need quickly.</li>
            <li>People scan rather than read on the web, so layout (paragraph breaks, headings, sub headings, bulleted lists) is very important.</li>
            <li>They read less of what's on the page - typically about 20-25% of what we've written. So we can't afford to waste a single word.</li>
            <li>Links - we need to use links cleverly to speed up the user's journey - that could mean signposting them within our site, or linking out to a different site.</li>
            <li>Literal language - there's no room in website copy for anything figurative, flowery or metaphorical. We need to be specific and make sure every phrase carries important information.</li>
            <li>Keywords - we need to make sure that terms users are looking for are featured prominently in our content. Using them upfront - in sentences as well as headings - helps users scan, and also helps with search engine optimisation (SEO).</li>
        </ul>
