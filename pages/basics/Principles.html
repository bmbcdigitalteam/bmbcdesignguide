        <h1>Principles</h1>
        <p>General design principles</p>
        <p>Status production</p>
        <h2>Form principles</h2>
        <p>These are principles that you should keep in mind when building forms so we can provide customers a
            consistent experience that exceeds their expectations.</p>
        <h3>Personal details</h3>
        <p>We should only ask for personal details when customers need access to their private information. Reporting
            something to us that is not personal to the customer should be possible anonymously.</p>
        <h3>Important first & gradual engagement</h3>
        <p>When presenting forms to customers the most important information should be the first questions we ask. For
            example; When reporting graffiti the first information the customer should be asked for is the location of
            the graffiti.</p>
        <p>When the customer is filling in an e-form we should collect information in the following order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incident details</li>
            <li>Personal details</li>
            <li>Payment details</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fewer fields</h3>
        <p>Capture only the data you need, every additional form field increases the likelyhood of a customer abandoning
            the transaction.</p>
        <h3>Exposing Options</h3>
        <p>When a small amount of options (generally less than 4) are available, don't hide them in a dropdown box they
            should be exposed via checkboxes or radio buttons.</p>
        <h3>Showing state</h3>
        <p>Make sure it's clear how far a customer is through a given journey, show them the number of steps they're on
            and how far through they are - and make sure important details such as the number of items and total value
            of the basket are visible throughout the journey.</p>
        <h3>Design for zero data</h3>
        <p>Use zero data states to provide an indication of what to do next; for example, rather than simply stating
            'Your shopping cart is empty'. You should provide a simple, natural language link to add a reference number
            in order to make a payment as shown in the below example:</p>
        <p class="highlight-blue">Your shopping cart is empty - <a href="">add your payment</a></p>
        <h3>Smart defaults</h3>
        <p>If we have enough information to suggest a smart default for a customer, we should pre-fill this information
            for them; for example, if a customer needs to provide both a billing and delivery address, it's a reasonable
            assumption that they will be the same - the second address should be pre-filled with the first. Although it
            should still be easy to change and replace these values.</p>
        <h3>Forgiving formats</h3>
        <p>When asking for user entry, rather than using complicated input types that require several mouse clicks, we
            should allow input in natural language and intepret it accurately on the server.</p>
        <p>For example; when asking for a duration in time in hours 2.5 and 2:30 should be interpreted as 2 and a half
            hours.</p>
        <p>Whenever a forgiving format is used we should provide a confirmation to verify we've interpreted the format
            correctly before completing a transaction.</p>
        <h3>Inline validation</h3>
        <p>We should provide client side inline validation in addition to server side validation on forms to allow quick
            error error corrections.</p>
        <h3>Progressive disclosure</h3>
        <p>Form fields should only be displayed when they are relevant; For example, when we ask a customer if they wish
            to be anonymous or provide their details we shouldn't display fields asking for their personal details until
            they have opted for this option.</p>
        <h3>Natural language</h3>
        <p>We may have circumstances where our form entry would benefit from natural language input, particularly when
            confirming details back to customers to allow them to change the entry prior to submission.</p>
        <!-- <div id="transparent-box"> -->
            <p class="transparent-box">I'd like you to collect <input id="bags-input" type="number" name="bags-input" max="20"> bags of 
                <select name="waste-type" id="waste-type">
                    <option value="clinical waste">clinical waste</option>
                    <option value="business waste">business waste</option>
                    <option value="other waste">other waste</option>
                </select> 
                for disposal for 
                <select name="who-for" id="who-for">
                    <option value="me">me</option>
                    <option value="someone else">someone else</option>
                </select> </p>
        <!-- </div> -->
        <h3>Set expectations</h3>
        <p>Prior to completing a transaction, or during feedback - we should provide an indication where possible of how
            long it will take for any recognizable outcome as a result of their query.</p>
        <h3>Provide feedback</h3>
        <p>When completing any activity, clear feedback should be shown to the user relating to the outcome. For
            example; submitting an e-form should thank the user for their report (and if possible provide a reference
            number).</p>
        <p>The same is true for internal applications, when users perform operations against data feedback should be
            displayed. For example; a list of documents which can be added or deleted, both these operations should
            display a feedback message.</p>
