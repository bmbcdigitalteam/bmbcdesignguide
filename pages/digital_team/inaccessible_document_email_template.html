            <li>Add a private note to the Digital Hub to say that we’ve sent the email so we can keep a record.

        <p>Digital Hub request: INSERT JOB ID</p>
        <p>Hello :)</p>
        <p>The document that you've asked us to publish on our website doesn't meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">accessibility guidelines</a>, so we're currently not able to add this.</p>
        <p>This is because: ***Add reason***</p>
        <p>It's really important that any document that's published on our website can be read by people who use assistive technology (such as a screen reader). This might be because they have a vision, hearing or cognitive impairment, or motor difficulties.</p>
        <p>Take a look at our <a href="https://digitalhub.barnsley.gov.uk/KnowledgeBase/View/333">Digital Hub</a> article for instructions, guides and videos to help you create accessible documents.</p>
        <p>Our digital champions also deliver virtual training sessions about how to create accessible documents.</p>
        <p>Please reattach the document to the Digital Hub request once it is fully accessible and we'll let you know when this has been published on our website.</p>
        <p>Thanks</p>
        <p>Digital Team</p>

        <h2>For documents that we've fixed but need making accessible next time</h2>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For documents that we’ve fixed quickly but service should have made accessible themselves.</li>
            <li>DO NOT send this if we have fixed something the service can’t fix themselves e.g. a table summary on a PDF. We don’t want to send this to people if a document has taken us a short period of time to fix and they couldn't have actually done it themselves.</li>
            <li>Add a private note to the Digital Hub to say that we've sent the email. Add the details to the <a href="https://barnsleycouncil.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/custserv/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4F5D88D6-23A3-4C12-B9BA-87F19E55432A%7D&file=Accessible%20documents%20service%20contacts.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&wdsle=0">accessible documents service contacts</a> spreadsheet.</li>
